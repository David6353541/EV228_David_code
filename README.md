# EV228_David_code
code for EV228 

When writing the code, I encountered some errors. I used CHATGPT to explain the meaning of that error, but later I realized it was a syntax error. At that time, I had used extra " " and ' ' symbols.





INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH


Scope: 
• Northern China: 42°N – 36°N, 106°E – 118°E northern region
• Eastern/central part of China: 36°N – 27°N, 105°E – 118°E central region
Data type: Precipitation (mm) 
Research Direction: The temporal and spatial variation trends of monthly average precipitation
Abstract: By conducting a simple analysis of the precipitation data within a specific range by code, this research aims to identify potential precipitation trends that are related to temporal/spatial variations. It is expected that the precipitation line in this area will show a northward shift trend, but this needs to be verified by the data results. It is similar to the content shown in the Poster. To ensure the relative accuracy of the data, I excluded the data from before 1960 and only used the data from 1960 to 2025 for analysis.

Hypothesis: The precipitation in the central region will decrease, while the precipitation in the northern region will increase slightly.
